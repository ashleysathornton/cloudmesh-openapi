c:\users\jonathan\venv\env3\lib\site-packages\connexion\apis\flask_api.py:192: FutureWarning: Implicit (flask) JSON serialization will change in the next major version. This is triggered because a response body is being serialized as JSON even though the mimetype is not a JSON type. This will be replaced by something that is mimetype-specific and may raise an error instead of silently converting everything to JSON. Please make sure to specify media/mime types in your specs.
